Hello everyone! 

My name is Drew Barnett, and I am currently a 1st year student at Clemson University's International Center for Automotive Research. I aspire to work in the automotive industry in the field of autonomy, where I hope that I may help build a future comprised of safe, clean, and efficient mobility for everyone. 

In this repository, you'll find various projects of mine from my Autonomy: Science and Systems course. I'll be adding all of my project and assignments here as I progress through the semester.
