Hello everyone! 

My name is Drew Barnett, and I am currently a 1st year student at Clemson University's International Center for Automotive Research. I aspire to work in the automotive industry in the field of autonomy, where I hope that I may help build a future comprised of safe, clean, and efficient mobility for everyone. 

In this repository, you'll find various projects of mine from my Machine Perception and Intelligence course. I'll be adding all of my project and assignments here as I progress through the semester.
